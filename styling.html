        <p>It's a little hard when you don't know what you're doing but nice when you get the hang of it</p>

        <div id="The start">
            <p>To change the backgorund color of your html page you can use an external css style 
                <br>
                To use an external css file make a css file with .css and use the link tag in your html file to link it to the css one
                <br>
                Example: "link rel="stylesheet" href="name.css"" the rel attribute stands for relationship
                <br>
                and then you want assign a class to the body tag "class="name""
                <br> 
                Then using the css file assign the color by typing . + the class name a curly brace followed by background-color: (hex of color) 
                <br>
                Example .name { background-color: #eeeeee;}
            </p>   
        </div>
